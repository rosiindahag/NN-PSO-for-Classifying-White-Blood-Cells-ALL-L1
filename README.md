# Classifying Immature White Blood Cells in ALL L1 Patient using Neural-Networks Particle Swarm Optimization

This repository is about predicting or classifying immature white blood cells from ALL L1 samples using neural networks
The process of classifying the immature white blood cells is shown in Figure 1.

The content of this repository contains :
1. Data Preprocessing
2. Features Selection
3. Classification

The primary dataset is used. The dataset is extracted from images obtained from blood samples of ALL L1 patients at Sardjito Hospital Yogyakarta using a digital microscope. The image obtained will go through a manual cropping process to separate each white blood cell. After cropping, the image will be given to the hematologist for labeling as shown in Figure 2.
